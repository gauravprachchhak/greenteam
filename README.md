## Analysis of the effects of Greenhouse gases and Vehicles in Use on Global Temperature Changes from 2005 - 2014
# Tools & Technologies Used

* [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
* [Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/)
* [Microsoft Azure ML Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/)
* [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/)

# Documentation

*To run this please refer [**RUNNING.md**](https://github.com/gauravprachchhak/greenteam/blob/master/RUNNING.md)*

**Data Sources:**
* GHCN : [Global Historical Climatology Network](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-ghcn)
* GHG : [Greenhouse Gases](https://www.wri.org/resources/data-sets/cait-country-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data)
* Vehicles : [Vehicles In Use](http://www.oica.net/category/vehicles-in-use/)

**The main goal of this project was to analyse the above mentioned datasets and answers questions like these:**

* Does the number of vehicles in use affect the temperature change?
* Which country had the highest ghg emissions by year? 
* What is the trend of various greenhouse gas emissions for various countries for specific time frame?
* How does the temperature change with variations in specific greenhouse gases by country and year?
* And so on...

**Ops Performed:**
* String Manipulation
* Unpivot
* Normalization
* Joins
* Entity Resolution
* Merge

**Microsoft Machine Learning Studio**
* You can find our ML model online.

**Microsoft Power BI**
* We have also published the analytics for this project that you find here.

**Microsoft Cosmos DB**
* Microsoft doesn't allow to publish the Database so we can not provide you link to view that but you can find some screenshots in the report.

**Note:**
*To be able to see the data in Azure Cosmos DB one needs to have a Microsoft Azure account.*
*To run this you need to create [**Microsoft Azure Cloud Account**](https://azure.microsoft.com).*
